# Sticky messages
This app lets you create sticky messages. Sticky messages are messages that always appear at the bottom of a channel. Simply set the channel in the Environment Variables and you are good to go! I recommend that you use the [Autocode's Embed Builder](https://autocode.com/tools/discord/embed-builder/) to generate the Sticky messages.

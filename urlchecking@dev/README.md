# Automatic URL scanner
This bot is made to stop the annoying url's that link to "free Discord Nitro" websites. It uses the [Phisherman API](https://phisherman.gg) to check if a url has been reported as suspicious and deletes the message if that is the case. It will also mute the user, so they cannot send any more links! The bot also includes a log with all suspicious url's that have been send. In the modlog, buttons are provided so staff members can easily ban or unmute the user.
